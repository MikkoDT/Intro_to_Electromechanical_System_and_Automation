### Course Rationale and Description
MexE 402: Introduction to Electro-mechanical Systems and Automation is designed for 2nd-year Mechatronics Engineering students to develop a strong foundation 
in the principles and applications of electromechanical systems. This course integrates mechanical power transmission, electrical motor control, and automation 
technologies, preparing students for more advanced topics in mechatronics and industrial automation.

Building on the knowledge from ENGG 409: Engineering Mechanics and EE 424: Circuits 1, this course explores the operation, control, and integration of 
electrical motors, power circuits, motor control devices, and electromechanical system optimization. Students will gain hands-on experience in motor starting 
methods, power transmission mechanisms, and control strategies using both analog and digital techniques, including Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) 
control and Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs).

Through theoretical discussions, laboratory experiments, and practical applications, students will develop the skills necessary to analyze, design, and 
troubleshoot electromechanical systems used in industrial automation. This course aims to equip future mechatronics engineers with the technical competence 
and problem-solving skills essential for modern automation and control systems.
